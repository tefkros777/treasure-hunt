<H1>Introduction</H1>
This project is about a location-based mobile game that implements the idea of a Treasure Hunt – also known as Scavenger Hunt – modified and adapted in ways to fit in the gaming culture of the 21st century. It is inspired by the success of games like Geocaching and Pokemon GO. This game is suitable for all genders and ages who have access to a GPS-enabled Android device.

<H2>Overview</H2>
Players travel to specific urban, suburban, or rural locations, set up by their peers. They have to interact with every location they visit by collecting clues from their surroundings. The clues can be used to solve puzzles, riddles and other tasks and can be validated through the app. On successful validation, a new location is revealed, and the process is repeated until players reach a final location which forms the treasure, then and get awards. Players can also hide treasures for their peers to find and get even more points. Ideally, every game should be unique and tell its own story. It can either walk players through less known yet interesting paths, show them around a new city or make use of the clues as a medium to teach the history of a place. It is an open-ended game with great flexibility.

<H4>Broader goals</H4>

Promotion of physical activity through walking and makes players aware of their surroundings and the area they play within. It has the potential to expand globally as it depends on its community of players for growth. It is also supported by an intelligent scoring system that encourages players to contribute to the expansion of the game and rewards them for doing so.
