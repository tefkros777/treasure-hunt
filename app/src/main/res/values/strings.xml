        Welcome to the Treasure Burial mode, it\'s great to have you onboard!
        \n\nThis is the mode where you get to go out and bury a treasure for some other buccaneer to find.
        \n\nBy playing this mode you are actively contributing to the game\'s community and you are awarded points for every treasure you hide.
        \n\nAll you need to do is go out, find some interesting location you want to share with the world, and bury your virtual treasure there. Then construct a virtual path of waypoints (clues) leading to that location, and that\'s all there is to it!

        \n
        From the Dashboard you can view information about your own account such as your Pirate Score, access the drawer menu and select one of the two game modes to play.
        \n\n
        TREASURE HUNT MODE
        \n
        \nIn this mode you act as a Hunter, and are looking for Treasures in your location, placed by fellow players.
        \nTreasure Hunts are routes made up of Waypoints - Real world locations that form a path leading to a final location.
        \nOnce at a waypoint, you will have to solve a specific task or puzzle, set up by the author (pirate) of the Treasure Hunt and enter your solution in the game to proceed.
        \nIf you successfully solve the task at the final location then the Treasure Hunt is considered solved and the Treasure found.
        \nEach Treasure Hunt you attend costs you a different amount of Pirate Points (depending on its difficulty).
        \nIf you successfully complete the Treasure Hunt, you are awarded Pirate Points that you can use to access other Treasure Hunts and unlock achievements.
        \n
        \nIf you ever find yourself in a situation where you do not have enough points to attend a certain Treasure Hunt, you might want to have a look at the other game mode to boost your score

        \n\n
        TREASURE BURIAL MODE
        \n
        \nIn this mode you will be acting as a Pirate, and will be creating your own Treasure Hunts in areas of your liking and interest that other players can search for in Treasure Hunt mode.
        \nTry to be creative! Think of unique, interesting locations near your area or far away. Try to make each of your games exciting, educational and fun.
        \nWhenever you finish a Treasure Burial session and successfully publish your Treasure, you will be awarded 20 Pirate Points as a reward for helping the game community grow.
